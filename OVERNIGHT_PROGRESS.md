## 💡 KEY DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Docker Architecture
- **Decision**: Use multi-service approach (app + collector)
- **Rationale**: Separation of concerns, easier scaling
- **Alternative Considered**: Single container with cron
- **Why Rejected**: Less flexible, harder to debug

### 2. Database Strategy
- **Decision**: Keep SQLite default, offer PostgreSQL option
- **Rationale**: Easy for development, scalable for production
- **Alternative Considered**: PostgreSQL only
- **Why Rejected**: Harder initial setup for users

### 3. API Key Strategy
- **Decision**: Document all options, recommend free tier first
- **Rationale**: Lower barrier to entry
- **Alternative Considered**: Require paid APIs upfront
- **Why Rejected**: Excludes users without budget
