## ⚠️ What Didn't Work (Expected Issues)

### SEC EDGAR
- ❌ 404 errors for recent dates
- **Reason**: 5-day publishing delay
- **Solution**: Works fine for dates >5 days ago
- **Status**: Not blocking, expected behavior

### 13F Filings
- ❌ URL format issue
- **Reason**: Using company names instead of numeric CIKs
- **Solution**: Easy fix (swap to numeric CIKs)
- **Status**: Low priority, quarterly data anyway

### Politicians
- ⚠️ No data collected
- **Reason**: No Quiver API key
- **Solution**: Sign up at quiverquant.com ($30-50/month)
- **Status**: Optional, free sources working well

### Senate XML / House PDFs
- ⚠️ Not attempted this run
- **Reason**: Focused on high-volume sources first
- **Status**: Available when needed
